# Just Another Auto Clicker

> *"it's just another auto clicker."*

## 🖱️ What is this?

This is a simple auto clicker that can:
- Simulate **mouse left clicks** 🖱️
- Simulate **spacebar keypresses** ⌨️
- Simulate **custom keypresses** (you choose the key!)

Start and stop the auto-clicker anytime with the **F1** key.  
Because sometimes, clicking manually is just too much.
